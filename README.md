## :books: Project Description
 
Geocaching is an outdoor activity where players hide random objects in random locations around a specific geographical area. The goal of the activity is to:
 1) hide objects for others to find
 2) locate objects hidden by others

If the player hides an object for others to find, the player must report the latitude and longitude of where they hid the object.

The object could be hidden include: under a rock in the forest, inside a tree stump, under a park bench, in a hole of a building‚Äôs brick wall.
